# Easy PHP App

The goal of this repository is to provide an extremely simple template for a PHP based application that uses twitter
oauth for user login. The database is handled by the JSON-to-MySQL repository (https://github.com/adamwulf/json-to-mysql)
for barebones database access with zero manual schema setup.

This repository is great for simple hobby projects, and to quickly get an idea off the table and into the wild. This
is not meant to scale to any reasonable degree at all. It's great for prototyping, terrible for production :)
